Delaney solubility is a computational model used to predict the aqueous solubility of organic compounds. It was developed by John Delaney in the late 1990s and is based on the analysis of a large database of experimental solubility data for diverse organic compounds.

The model uses a set of 4 molecular descriptors (LogP, molecular weight, number of hydrogen bond donors, and number of hydrogen bond acceptors) to estimate the solubility of a compound in water. These descriptors are calculated from the 2D chemical structure of the compound and are used to fit a regression equation that predicts the natural logarithm of the solubility in mol/L.

The Delaney solubility model is widely used in drug discovery and chemical toxicology to prioritize and design compounds with desirable solubility profiles. However, it should be noted that the model has limitations and may not be accurate for certain classes of compounds or under extreme conditions.
